Python Basics 
The "Programming Basics" course provides basic programming skills. This includes writing basic coding skills, working with a development environment (IDE), using variables and data, operators and expressions, working with the console (reading input and printing results), using conditional constructions (if, if-else) and loops (for, while, do-while).The course lasts 8 weeks.Training takes place in the form of lectures and exercises plus more than 100 homework assignments.The main topics of the course are:

1. Python first steps in coding - working with Python and PyCharm,variables and data types, simple operations - work with text and numbers
2. Conditional Statements - comparison operators, conditional constructions, rounding and formatting, debugging, series of checks, variable life
3. Conditional Statements Advanced - nested conditional constructions, logical operators, priority of conditions
4. For loop - repeat blocks of code, work with more complex for llops, work with text
